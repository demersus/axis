Axis Sass Framework
--------------------------

Axis is a personal project of mine to create a toolkit of sass mixins to aide in development of Rails 3 applications using html 5.

=========================

Axis utilizes the existing work of the compass sass project by including their modules directly in the source tree.
My main reason for not using compass is the fact that I do not like to have compass watch my scss files.  Sass does that automatically.
